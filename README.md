Highly inspired by the huge number of bugs reports provided by the PSPDFKit team
https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com

This repository contains most of our current radars. We keep a README.md file in each folder to backup the text.


Sometimes Apple is to blame, sometimes is our fault. Most radars include a workaround. Pull request are appreciated if you find a better solution.
